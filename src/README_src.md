# Dynamical systems for craving

## Description of Python scripts

Below is a description of the main scripts used in the project to model the dynamics between craving and cues in substance use disorders.

- **Autocorrelation_SARIMAX.py**: calculates autocorrelation to analyze temporal dependencies in craving and cue data using SARIMAX
- **Simulation_SARIMAX_Crav_to_cues.py**: simulates the influence of craving on cues
- **Simulation_SARIMAX_Cues_to_crav.py**: simulates the influence of cues on craving
- **SARIMAX.py**: functions to set up and fit the SARIMAX model
- **Sensitivity_analysis.py**: performs a sensitivity analysis on SARIMAX parameters
- **Simulation_SARIMAX_Crav_to_cues.py**: built basic model for craving → cues interactions
- **Simulation_SARIMAX_Cues_to_crav.py**: built basic model for cues → craving interactions

Each script serves a specific purpose within the project, enabling precise modeling of craving and cue interactions.
